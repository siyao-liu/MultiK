Description: Estimation of optimal cluster number (K) is a crucial step in clustering, and one that is often ignored. Most current scRNAseq group characterization approaches lack a “multi-resolution” perspective by restricting the goal of the analysis to a single resolution level. MultiK is a data-driven tool that allows for objective selection of multiple insightful K, and achieves high robustness by combining multiple resolution solutions together through a consensus approach that also uses sub-sampling.
